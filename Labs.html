        <center><h1>OUR GAME </h1></center>
        <h3>Our game is composed of 4 specific scenarios in the two topics of stress management and saving money. Scenarios include being overworked, normalizing seeking help and a person to talk to, keeping track of necessities and keeping up with responsibilities, and career paths.</h3>
            <h3> First lab: Having a lot of tasks to do can lead to higher levels of stress.</h3>
            <h4>Stress defined is the body's natural response to a challenging situation. Having stress over a long period of time can have degrading effects on health and well-being. Studies show that there is a correlation between stress and productivity. In fact reducing stress levels can lead to having lower blood pressure and tolerance towards people. Stress is common at all ages and impacts a large amount of teens due to having parent pressure, peer pressure, school work, extracurriculars, the weight of friendships, and relationships on them.</h4>
            <h3> Second lab: Normalizing getting help and therapy </h3>
            <h4> Many people don't get help because of what other's might think. The current perception for having a therapist from others is normally that "Therapy is for physchos." As a result of these perceptions many people miss out on the chance to get their feelings out, better themselves, and learn about themselves through therapy more.</h4>
            <h3>Third lab: Keeping track and up with necessities and responsibilities</h3>
            <h4>For youth to live their young adult and adult life to their fullest it is important they know how to pay taxes, pay off loans, buy necessities to keep up with their hunger, thirst, and sleep.</h4>
            <h3> Fourth lab: Career paths and earning</h3>
            <h4> Picking the right pathway is important because it will certainly impact what you can buy, your passion, and your life overall. For youth deciding there life can be stressful and seem like a  whole lot to decide, but our lab in this game simulates it in a calm way. </h4>
